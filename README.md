# BatRunner
This is a small game developed in Unity during a 24 hours Game Jame at the AIV's Level Up School Days event held in Rome in October 2020. I was the only programmer, and half of our team was composed by learning kids from the local school.

## The Theme
Barriers. During our really fast brainstorming we came up with this idea: bats don't see and find their orientation using some kind of "sonar" waves system. So in this game there are two kind of barriers: the view, and the stalactites you hit against and die. But don't worry, about the first one, you have the famous sonar i talked about earlier to help :P

## The Game
Basically, you are a bat flying straight forward into a cave. The more you fly into the cave before dying, the higher the points.
To make things more complicated, the cave is totally black. The sonar will help you, but the more you travel, the faster it goes, so you will have to resist to some kind of epilessy.
The cave sections are full of dangers and wonders:
- If you hit a sparkle, you increase your distance points multiplier.
- If you hit a spider web, you reset your distance points multiplier.
- If you hit an obstacle... game over.

## The Experience
It was the first time joining a team of totally unknown people, with very few pratctical experience (for them), and with so few hours at my disposal i had to do everything i could to end this project in the given time.

## What would i do better NOW?
- The main thing i regret is the way obstacles are spawned all around the cave: to cut the times i used raycasts everytime it was possible. I perfectly know it is B-A-D, but, you got the idea of the situation.
- The y clamped movement of the bat does not convince me, but i have followed the designers ideas, so, whatever. Sometimes you think you can reach the sparkles but then the bat just stops and you go full rage. Deal with it.
- I would probably save the high score. I mean, the game's main attraction is to beat the highest score, so, don't saving it, a big part of the game is missing.

## The result
We didn't win the jam, but our table was the only one CONSTANTLY FULL of people trying to beat each other's high scores. It must mean something.
Anyway, my record is about 10k, if you beat it, you can tell you're a tough guy!

## What now?
Absolutely nothing. I don't think i will ever update this game again, it was a cool and funny experience, i'm proud of my team and of the final result, and that's it.
